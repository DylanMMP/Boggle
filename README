Welcome to Boggle!
This code was all written by Dylan Marcum-Pollard for his CS 201 project at The University of Alabama.

In order to play Boggle, you must do the following:
  1. Get a text file in which all non-proper nouns composed of ONLY english characters that 
     are ENTIRELY lower case with only one word per line. 
  (If you do not have one such text file, there are instructions below to get one).
  2. Ensure that the text file is named wordList.txt (Capitalization is important!)
  3. Place wordList.txt in the same folder as the source code.
  4. Enter the source code folder and type "make boggle" (Again, capitalization matters!)
  5. Enjoy!

If you do not have a valid text file, here are two ways to get them:

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

Question: Why do we use a trie?
Answer: We use a trie because it is one of the most optimal ways to store a large number of words with a quick search time
        because the search time for any given word is its word length.

Question: Why do we limit the word length at 45 characters?
Answer:   The longest word in the English language is pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis which is 45 letters.

Question: Why is there no time limit for multiplayer!?
Answer:   Originally, there was! And if you go back to an earlier version of the project you'll find the code for that.
          However, during playtesting my friends and I found that the project was more fun (read: stressful) without a time limit.
          
Question: My board loaded but it won't let me play! HELP!
Answer:   Your board size is too large! Boards above 100 x 100 boards take ~20 seconds to find all words. 
          1000 x 1000 boards take over an hour to find every word.
